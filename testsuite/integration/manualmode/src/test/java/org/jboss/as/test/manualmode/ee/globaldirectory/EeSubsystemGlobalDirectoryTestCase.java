        Scenario 1 - major functionality

        While we pre-check testing this feature, we found instability while restart server.
        That’s why it is required several restart of server.
        Purpose of third restart is verify if the feature is stable.

        Check if global-directory are registered properly and verify his attributes
        Restart server
        Deploy test application deployment
        Call some method from global-directory in deployment and verify method output
        Change the test jars dependency of test deployment application in temporary directory
        Restart server
        Verify in log if application deployment service is loaded correctly
        Call some method from global-directory in deployment and verify method output
