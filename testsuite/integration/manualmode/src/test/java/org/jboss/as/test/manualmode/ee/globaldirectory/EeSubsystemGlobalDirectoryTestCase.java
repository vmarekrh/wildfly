        Scenario 1 - major functionality

        While we pre-check testing this feature, we found instability while restart server.
        Thatâ€™s why it is required several restart of server.
        Purpose of third restart is verify if the feature is stable.

        Restart server
        Deploy test application deployment
        Call some method from global-directory in deployment and verify method output
        Change the test jars dependency of test deployment application in temporary directory
